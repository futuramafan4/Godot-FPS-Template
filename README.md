Godot-FPS-Template
Godot 3.5 FPS template with precipitant health and ammo, menus, and basic save/load function.
This project is based on Droivox Godot Engine FPS - https://github.com/Droivox/Godot-Engine-FPS

This is a fork of my own personal FPS project, with most of the basic features that I have created, or added in from other projects. The added features include: health, health packs, ammo packs, two maps, persistance of health and ammo between maps, basic saving and loading (ammo, health, current map only), menus and a flashlight.
